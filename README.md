**Hi there** 

Here Manuel Salinas (_iOS Senior Engineer_)

I've been developing solutions for **Apple** devices (_iPhone/ iPad/ Apple Watch_) since more than 10 years, constantly learning using languages such as `Objective-C`, `Swift` and now adopting `SwiftUI`.
Involved in multicultural work groups.

The idea of my Github repo is a kind of useful information and solutions trying to improve your profesional background and implementations, no matter if you're a Jr or Sr level. Nobody knows everything. So, take a time to learn something new every day.
